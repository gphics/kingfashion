    name: "AGBADA",
    description: `The agbada, also known as the “grand boubou”, is a long, flowing robe worn by men in Nigeria and other West African countries. The agbada has a long and rich history, dating back to the 13th century when it was first worn by the royalty of the Kingdom of Benin. The agbada is typically made from luxurious fabrics like brocade or damask, and it is often decorated with intricate embroidery, usually depicting symbols of wealth, status, or family history. The sleeves of the agbada are often wide and loose, which was originally designed to allow for easy movement while riding horses or hunting.`,

    name: "DASHIKI",
    description: `The dashiki, also known as a “fugu” or “angela”, is a loose, colorful shirt with a V-neck and wide sleeves. The dashiki originated in West Africa, and it became popular in the 1960s and 1970s as a symbol of African pride and independence. The dashiki was often worn by civil rights leaders and activists, like Martin Luther King Jr. and Stokely Carmichael. The Dashiki can be worn in different ways, like with the sleeves rolled up or down, and it can be paired with matching pants or a kufi, a traditional African hat. We could also mention that the dashiki can be made from different fabrics, like cotton, silk, or wax print.`,

    name: "THE SENATOR",
    description: `The “senator”, is another traditional outfit from Nigeria. The senator is a three-piece outfit consisting of a long shirt, a pair of pants, and a matching hat called a “file”. The senator is similar to the agbada, but it has a more modern, tailored fit. The senator was developed in the mid-20th century, as Nigerian men sought a more modern and tailored alternative to the agbada. The senator was designed to be more fitted and stylish, while still retaining the traditional elements of the agbada, like the embroidery and the wide sleeves. The senator is still widely worn today, especially for formal occasions.`,
